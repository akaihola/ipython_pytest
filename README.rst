ipython_pytest
--------------

This little IPython extension gives you the ability to
run tests using Pytest in an IPython Notebook.

The motivation for the extension was to make it possible to
demonstrate test-driven development using pytest in an IPython
notebook driven presentation.

This extension does not attempt to enable using notebooks as test
suites. The intention is also not to collect test results from
multiple cells, but to do separate test runs for cells in an
interactive presentation.

This extension attempts to achieve for pytest_ what the
ipython_nose_ extension does for nose_. Unfortunately it isn't able
to inject globals from the notebook environment into the test like the
``%%nose`` `cell magic in ipython_nose`_. Instead, in
``ipython_pytest``, all imports, constants and helper functions need
to be contained in the test cell itself.

Installation
------------

* Make sure your IPython Notebook server can import ``ipython_pytest.py`` (e.g.
  copy it to a directory in your ``PYTHONPATH``, or modify ``PYTHONPATH``
  before starting IPython Notebook). It's also probably sufficient to have
  ``ipython_pytest.py`` in the directory from which you run the notebook, e.g.::

    $ ls
    ipython_pytest.py
    $ ipython notebook

* You can also install it in a virtualenv in developent mode::

    $ cd ipython-pytest
    $ pip install -e .


Usage
-----

* Add a cell containing::

    %load_ext ipython_pytest

  somewhere in your notebook.

* Write tests that conform to Pytest conventions, e.g.::

    def test_arithmetic():
        assert 1+1 == 2

* Add a cell consisting of::

    %%pytest

    def test_my_stuff():
        assert 42 == 42

  to your notebook and run that cell. That will discover your
  ``test_*`` functions, run them, and show console output from
  Pytest.

* Pass standard Pytest arguments to the magic::

    %%pytest --tb=short


Caveats
-------

* None of the objects defined in other cells of the notebook are available
  in the test cell.
